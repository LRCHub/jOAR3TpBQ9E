Sometimes those city lights, you can't ignore
Sometimes those Euro sights will shake your core

But you've been sucking down a fine French wine
While I was stomping grapes from a local vine
I think I was just a little hard to recognize before

You should have known me all the time
You should have loved me all the time

Sometimes those highest highs will leave you bored
Sometimes the English country side remembers war

But you've been sucking down a fine French wine
While I was stomping grapes from a local vine
I think I was just a little hard to recognize before

You should have known me all the time
You should have loved me all the time
You should have known me all the time
You should have loved me all the time
