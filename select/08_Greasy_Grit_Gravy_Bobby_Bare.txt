Mama, mama, me oh my
I don't want no catfish eyes
I don't want no lizard spleens
Gimme greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens
Big fat pie and mobo beans
Make you wanna split your jeans
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Hey Marie will you be mine
I'm gonna take you out to dine
We're gonna live beyond our means
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

I kissed my wife and sold the baby
A goin' off to join the navy
All they eat on submarines
Is greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens
Big fat pie and mobo beans
Make you wanna split your jeans
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Me and little English Alice
We went down to Buckingham Palace
Walked in on the King and Queen
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens
Big fat pie and mobo beans
Make you wanna split your jeans
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Doctor, doctor, help me please
I'm neurotic as I can be
I keep doin' it in my dreams
Oh, greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Dixie Bell she's southern fried
She don't want no champagne wine
You wanna get into her jeans
Give her greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens.

Greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens
Big fat pie and mobo beans
Make you wanna split your jeans
Eatin' greasy grit gravy and gizzard greens...
