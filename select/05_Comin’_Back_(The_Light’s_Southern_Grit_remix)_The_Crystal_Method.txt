I know that i don't understand
Where my feelings roam
I've got to look outside again
And wonder where i have gone

I looked into someone's eyes again
And it's been oh so long
I never meant it to talk again
I tried to silence you

You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more

And then you come back
And on my mind
You tried to make me look good
You know i just don't have the time
I never ever understood)

You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more
You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more)

You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more
You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more
(You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more)
You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more
You keep coming back again
You keep coming back for more
